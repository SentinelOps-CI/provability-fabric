# Sprint Completion Test Suites

This directory contains comprehensive test suites to validate all sprint completion requirements for Provability-Fabric.

## 🎯 Sprint Requirements

The following requirements are tested to ensure sprint completion:

1. **Enhanced Adapters (HTTP-GET, File-Read)**
   - Security enforcement (seccomp)
   - Effect signatures
   - Error handling
   - Performance validation

2. **Epoch & Revocation Semantics**
   - Epoch management
   - Time-based access control
   - Revocation mechanisms
   - Certificate lifecycle management

3. **NI Bridge Integration**
   - Protocol bridging
   - Data packet transmission
   - Latency optimization
   - Network stability

4. **SLOs, Alerts, and Dashboards**
   - Service Level Objectives
   - Alert generation and delivery
   - Dashboard functionality
   - Metrics collection

5. **Advanced Testing Suites**
   - Model-based testing
   - Risk-based testing
   - Comprehensive system validation
   - Performance and security testing

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Individual Test Suites

Run each test suite individually:

```bash
# Enhanced Adapters
python tests/integration/test_enhanced_adapters.py

# Epoch & Revocation
python tests/integration/test_epoch_revocation.py

# NI Bridge Integration
python tests/integration/test_ni_bridge_integration.py

# SLOs, Alerts, and Dashboards
python tests/integration/test_slos_alerts_dashboards.py

# Advanced Testing Suites
python tests/integration/test_advanced_testing_suites.py
```

### Master Test Runner

Run all test suites at once using the master runner:

```bash
python tests/integration/run_sprint_completion_tests.py
```

The master runner will:
- Execute all test suites in sequence
- Provide comprehensive reporting
- Give sprint completion recommendations
- Generate detailed JSON reports

## 📊 Test Results

Each test suite generates:
- Console output with detailed progress
- JSON report files in test-specific workspaces
- Success/failure summaries
- Performance metrics where applicable

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)
- Access to test environment
- Proper permissions for file operations

## 🎉 Sprint Completion Criteria

A sprint is considered complete when:
- ✅ All 5 test suites pass successfully
- ✅ All requirements are validated
- ✅ System behavior meets specifications
- ✅ Performance and security requirements are met

## 📝 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout values in test configurations
2. **Permission Errors**: Ensure proper file/directory permissions
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Install required Python packages
4. **Environment Issues**: Check environment variables and configurations

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging, modify test files to include:
- Verbose logging
- Extended error reporting
- Step-by-step execution tracking

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

These test suites can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
- Run on every commit
- Block merges on failures
- Generate reports for stakeholders
- Track sprint progress over time

## 📈 Metrics and Reporting

The test suites provide:
- Success rates per requirement
- Execution time tracking
- Coverage metrics
- Performance benchmarks
- Security validation results

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new test cases:
- Follow existing patterns
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add appropriate documentation
- Ensure backward compatibility

## 📞 Support
