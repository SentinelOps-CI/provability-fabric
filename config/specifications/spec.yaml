    category: "security"
    
  REQ-0002:
    statement: "The agent SHALL log all actions with timestamps and context for audit purposes"

nonFunctional:
  NFR-0001:
    statement: "Agent response time shall not exceed 500ms for 95% of requests"
    rationale: "Ensure responsive user experience"
    metric: "P95 latency ≤ 500ms"
    owner: "Operations Lead"
    priority: "high"

  AC-0002:
    description: "Complete action logs are generated with timestamps and context"
    testProcedure: "Execute agent operations and verify log completeness"
    successCriteria: "All actions logged with required metadata"
    
  AC-0003:
    description: "Budget limits are enforced with zero violations during testing"
    testProcedure: "Execute operations exceeding budget limits and verify enforcement"
