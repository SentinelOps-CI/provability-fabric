# Provability Fabric Security Overview

*This document provides a comprehensive security overview for auditors, security teams, and compliance officers.*

## Executive Summary

Provability Fabric is a zero-trust, enclave-based system that provides cryptographic guarantees for AI system safety and compliance. The system enforces data access policies through cryptographic attestation, capability-based access control, and comprehensive audit trails.

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Design Principles

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request is verified regardless of source
2. **Least Privilege**: Access is granted only to the minimum necessary permissions
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: All activities are logged and monitored in real-time
