# Security Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive security documentation for the Provability-Fabric framework, including threat models, security policies, and best practices.

## Security Overview

Provability-Fabric implements a multi-layered security architecture that provides end-to-end protection for AI agent deployments. The framework combines formal verification, runtime enforcement, and hardware-level security to ensure behavioral guarantees.

## Available Documents

### Core Security
- **[Security Overview](overview.md)** - Comprehensive security architecture and principles
- **[Threat Model](threat_model.md)** - Detailed threat analysis and mitigation strategies
- **[SLSA Framework](slsa.md)** - Supply chain security and attestation

### Security Components
- **Attestation Service** - Hardware-level security and verification
- **Policy Enforcement** - Runtime security monitoring and control
- **Cryptographic Verification** - Proof validation and signature verification

## Security Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture

- **Never Trust, Always Verify** - All components are verified before execution
- **Least Privilege** - Minimal access and permissions required
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Real-time security validation

### 2. Formal Verification

- **Mathematical Proofs** - Behavioral properties proven mathematically
- **Lean Verification** - Machine-checkable proof validation
- **Property Guarantees** - Formal guarantees of system behavior

### 3. Runtime Security

- **Sidecar Monitoring** - Continuous runtime behavior validation
- **Policy Enforcement** - Real-time constraint checking
- **Anomaly Detection** - Identification of unexpected behavior

### 4. Supply Chain Security

- **Provenance Tracking** - Complete supply chain transparency
- **Attestation** - Cryptographic proof of component integrity
- **Verification** - Automated validation of all components

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Security

- **Digital Signatures** - All proofs and specifications are signed
- **Hash Verification** - Integrity checking of all components
- **Key Management** - Secure key storage and rotation

### Runtime Security

- **Container Isolation** - Secure execution environments
- **Network Policies** - Controlled network access
- **Resource Limits** - Prevention of resource exhaustion

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **Security Events** - Real-time security event monitoring
- **Policy Violations** - Immediate alerts for security breaches
- **Audit Logging** - Complete audit trail of all activities
