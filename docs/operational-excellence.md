# Operational Excellence & Market-Launch Sprint

This document describes the implementation of **Prompt 40: Operational Excellence & Market-Launch Sprint**, which completes the remaining items from Kit v6 (Prompts 37-40) and adds four new capabilities for Kit v7.

## Overview

The operational excellence sprint implements five key capabilities:

1. **Cross-region disaster recovery & zero-downtime upgrades**
2. **Per-tenant usage metering â†’ bill-ready cost reports**
3. **Adapter & spec marketplace with semantic-version rules**
4. **End-to-end supply-chain reproducibility (Nix + in-toto attestations)**
5. **Stochastic proof-regression harness (random spec perturbations)**

## 1. Cross-Region Disaster Recovery & Zero-Downtime Upgrades
