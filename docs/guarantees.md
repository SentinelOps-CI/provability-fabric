# System Guarantees

## Overview

This document defines the explicit guarantees provided by the Provability-Fabric system, backed by formal verification, runtime enforcement, and continuous monitoring.

## Core Security Guarantees

### G1: Non-Interference (Tenant Isolation)

**Statement**: No tenant can access data belonging to another tenant.

**Formal Definition**: 
```lean
∀ trace : ActionTrace, ∀ tenant1 tenant2 : Tenant,
  tenant1 ≠ tenant2 →
  ¬∃ data, data ∈ outputs_of_trace trace ∧ 
           cross_tenant_access(data, tenant1, tenant2)
```

**Runtime Enforcement**:
- Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL
- Tenant-specific index shards in retrieval gateway
- ABAC policies with strict tenant matching
- Physical data partitioning

**Verification Evidence**:
- Lean proof: `cross_tenant_isolation` theorem
- Access receipts with tenant validation
- ABAC fuzz testing: 0 violations in 100k queries

**Monitoring**:
- Real-time tenant boundary validation
- Cross-tenant access attempt alerts
- Daily audit of access receipts

### G2: Capability Soundness

**Statement**: All actions require valid capabilities; no privilege escalation possible.

**Formal Definition**:
```lean
∀ trace : ActionTrace, ∀ caps : List Capability,
  system_invariant trace caps _ _ →
  ∀ action ∈ actions_of_trace trace,
    ∃ cap ∈ caps, cap_allows_action cap action
```

**Runtime Enforcement**:
- Ed25519-signed capability tokens
- Token validation on every request
- Capability-to-action mapping verification
- Token expiration and revocation

**Verification Evidence**:
- Lean proof: `capability_soundness` theorem
- Capability token audit trail
- Authorization failure monitoring

**Monitoring**:
- Failed capability checks alerting
- Token usage analytics
- Privilege escalation detection

### G3: Plan Separation

**Statement**: No action can execute without prior policy kernel approval.

**Formal Definition**:
```lean
∀ trace : ActionTrace, ∀ kernel_approvals : List String,
  plan_separation trace kernel_approvals →
  ∀ action ∈ actions_of_trace trace,
    action.action_id ∈ kernel_approvals
```

**Runtime Enforcement**:
- Mandatory plan validation before execution
- Sidecar enforcement of plan requirements
- Action-to-plan linking verification
- Plan expiration and invalidation

**Verification Evidence**:
- Lean proof: `plan_validation_preserves_invariants` theorem
- Plan validation audit logs
- Sidecar violation monitoring

**Monitoring**:
- Unplanned action detection
- Plan compliance reporting
- Kernel bypass attempt alerts

### G4: PII Egress Protection

**Statement**: No personally identifiable information (PII) is emitted in system outputs.

**Formal Definition**:
```lean
∀ trace : ActionTrace,
  pii_egress_protection trace →
  ∀ action ∈ actions_of_trace trace,
  ∀ data ∈ action.output_data,
    ¬is_pii data
```

**Runtime Enforcement**:
- Egress firewall with PII detection
- Multi-layer PII pattern matching
- Content redaction and blocking
- Certificate generation for all egress

**Verification Evidence**:
- Egress certificates with detection results
- Red team testing: 0 critical leaks in 50k adversarial prompts
- False positive rate < 1.5%

**Monitoring**:
- Real-time PII detection alerting
- Egress certificate validation
- Pattern bypass detection

### G5: Differential Privacy Bound

**Statement**: Total privacy budget consumption never exceeds configured limits.

**Formal Definition**:
```lean
∀ trace : ActionTrace, ∀ epsilon_max : Float,
  dp_bound trace epsilon_max →
  eps_of_trace trace ≤ epsilon_max
```

**Runtime Enforcement**:
- Privacy budget tracking per tenant
- Epsilon consumption monitoring
- Request rejection when budget exceeded
- Budget reset on time intervals

**Verification Evidence**:
- Budget consumption audit trail
- Attestations with epsilon limits
- DP violation monitoring

**Monitoring**:
- Budget exhaustion alerts
- Consumption rate analysis
- Anomaly detection
