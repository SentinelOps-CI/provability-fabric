# Architecture Overview

Provability-Fabric is designed as a layered architecture that provides formal verification, runtime enforcement, and transparency for AI agent deployments. This document describes the key architectural components and their interactions.

## System Architecture

The framework consists of several interconnected layers that work together to provide end-to-end behavioral guarantees:

## Core Components

### 1. Specification Bundles

Specification bundles are the foundation of the system, containing:

- **Agent Specifications** - YAML-based definitions of agent behavior
- **Lean Proofs** - Formal mathematical proofs of behavioral properties
- **Capability Definitions** - Resource and permission specifications
- **Policy Rules** - Runtime enforcement policies

```yaml
name: ai-agent
version: 1.0.0
capabilities:
  - name: text_generation
    constraints:
      max_length: 1000
      content_filter: true
proofs:
  - name: behavior_verification
    type: lean
    file: proofs/behavior.lean
```

### 2. Runtime Guards

Runtime guards provide continuous monitoring and enforcement:

- **Sidecar Watchers** - Monitor agent execution in real-time
- **Policy Enforcement** - Apply behavioral constraints
- **Resource Monitoring** - Track resource usage and limits
- **Anomaly Detection** - Identify unexpected behavior patterns

### 3. Verification Engine

The verification engine validates agent specifications:

- **Lean Proof Checker** - Verifies mathematical proofs
- **Neural Network Verifiers** - Uses Marabou for NN properties
- **Hybrid System Analyzers** - Uses DryVR for complex systems
- **Proof Quality Gates** - Ensures proof completeness and correctness

### 4. Admission Controller

The admission controller validates deployments:

- **Proof Verification** - Checks proof validity before deployment
- **Policy Compliance** - Ensures deployment meets security requirements
- **Resource Validation** - Verifies resource allocation and limits
- **Signature Verification** - Validates cryptographic signatures

## Data Flow

### Deployment Flow

1. **Agent Creation** - Developer creates agent specification
2. **Proof Development** - Mathematical proofs are written in Lean
3. **Bundle Creation** - Specification and proofs are packaged
4. **Verification** - Admission controller validates the bundle
5. **Deployment** - Agent is deployed with runtime monitoring
6. **Runtime Enforcement** - Sidecar watchers monitor execution

### Runtime Flow

1. **Request Processing** - Agent receives incoming requests
2. **Policy Check** - Runtime guards verify request compliance
3. **Execution** - Agent processes the request
4. **Response Validation** - Output is checked against constraints
5. **Logging** - All activities are logged to transparency ledger

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security

- **Cryptographic Verification** - All proofs are cryptographically signed
- **Runtime Isolation** - Agents run in isolated containers
- **Policy Enforcement** - Continuous monitoring and constraint enforcement
- **Audit Trail** - Complete transparency ledger for all activities

### Attestation Service

The attestation service provides hardware-level security:

- **Enclave Verification** - Validates trusted execution environments
- **Key Management** - Secure key release and management
- **Chain of Trust** - Establishes trust from hardware to application

## Performance Architecture

### WASM Worker Pool

- **Parallel Processing** - Multiple WASM workers for concurrent verification
- **Resource Management** - Efficient memory and CPU allocation
- **Load Balancing** - Distributes verification tasks across workers

### Batch Operations

- **Cryptographic Batching** - Efficient signature verification
- **Proof Aggregation** - Combines multiple proofs for efficiency
- **Cache Management** - Intelligent caching of verification results

## Integration Points

### Kubernetes Integration

- **Custom Resources** - CRDs for agent specifications
- **Admission Webhooks** - Automatic validation of deployments
- **Operator Pattern** - Automated management of agent lifecycles

### CI/CD Integration

- **Proof Building** - Automated proof compilation and verification
- **Quality Gates** - Proof quality and performance checks
- **Release Validation** - Comprehensive testing before deployment

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Stateless Services** - Core services can be scaled horizontally
- **Load Balancing** - Distributed verification across multiple nodes
- **Database Sharding** - Transparency ledger can be sharded

### Performance Optimization

- **Proof Caching** - Cache frequently used verification results
- **Async Processing** - Non-blocking verification operations
- **Resource Pooling** - Efficient resource allocation and reuse

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection

- **Performance Metrics** - Verification time, throughput, latency
- **Resource Usage** - CPU, memory, and network utilization
- **Policy Violations** - Count and types of constraint violations

### Alerting

- **Policy Violations** - Immediate alerts for constraint breaches
- **Performance Degradation** - Alerts for verification slowdowns
- **System Health** - Overall system status and availability

## Future Architecture

### Planned Enhancements

- **Multi-Cloud Support** - Extend beyond Kubernetes
- **Edge Computing** - Lightweight verification for edge devices
- **Federated Verification** - Distributed proof verification
- **AI-Assisted Proofs** - Automated proof generation assistance

## Conclusion

Provability-Fabric's architecture provides a robust foundation for deploying AI agents with mathematical guarantees. The layered design ensures separation of concerns while maintaining strong security and performance characteristics. The framework is designed to scale with your needs while maintaining the core principles of formal verification and runtime enforcement.
