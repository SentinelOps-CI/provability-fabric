# Optimization Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of optimization tasks OPT-06 through OPT-10 for the Provability-Fabric system. All optimizations have been implemented with state-of-the-art software engineering practices, comprehensive testing, and production-ready code.

## OPT-06: Long-lived Connections & Pools

### Goal
Reduce tail latency caused by connection handshakes by implementing proper connection pooling, HTTP/2, and keep-alive mechanisms.

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

#### Changes Made

1. **Enhanced reqwest clients** in multiple Rust services:
   - `runtime/sidecar-watcher/src/telemetry.rs`
   - `runtime/tool-broker/src/main.rs`
   - `runtime/egress-firewall/src/main.rs`
   - `runtime/retrieval-gateway/src/main.rs`

2. **Connection Pooling Configuration**:
   ```rust
   let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
       .pool_max_idle_per_host(10)           // Optimize for typical load
       .pool_idle_timeout(Duration::from_secs(90))  // Keep connections alive
       .http2_prior_knowledge()              // Force HTTP/2 for better performance
       .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))     // Request timeout
       .connect_timeout(Duration::from_secs(10))     // Connection timeout
       .tcp_keepalive(Some(Duration::from_secs(30))) // TCP keepalive
       .build()
       .expect("Failed to create HTTP client");
   ```

3. **Metrics Integration**:
   - Added connection pool size monitoring
   - Request duration histograms
   - Success/failure counters
   - Connection reuse metrics

   - Redis-based caching layer
   - In-memory cache fallback
   - Policy hash-based cache invalidation
   - 60-second TTL for cached results

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   ```rust
   // Redis cache for attestation results

   // KEK handle caching
   let cache_key = format!("kek:{}", policy_hash);
   ```

   struct InstancePool {
       instances: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Vec<PooledInstance>>>>,
       max_pool_size: usize,
       max_crashes: u32,
       health_check_interval: Duration,
       backpressure_semaphore: Arc<Semaphore>,
   }
   ```

3. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Instance health status tracking
   - Crash count monitoring
   - Automatic cleanup of unhealthy instances
   - Pool utilization metrics

#### Dependencies Added

## OPT-09: Ledger Partitioning & Indices

### Goal
Accelerate database queries and reduce costs through table partitioning and optimized indices.

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

#### Changes Made

1. **Database Migration** (`runtime/ledger/prisma/migrations/20250101000000_optimize_performance/`):
   - Monthly table partitioning for time-series data
   - Composite indices on `(tenant, ts DESC)` and `(plan_id, ts)`
   - Automatic partition creation functions
   - Maintenance procedures (VACUUM/ANALYZE)

2. **Partitioning Strategy**:
   ```sql
   -- Monthly partitioning for UsageEvent and TenantInvoice
   CREATE TABLE "UsageEvent_partitioned" (
       LIKE "UsageEvent" INCLUDING ALL
   ) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);
   ```

3. **Composite Indices**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY "UsageEvent_tenant_created_at_idx" 
   ON "UsageEvent" (tenant_id, created_at DESC);
   
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY "UsageEvent_plan_created_at_idx" 
   ON "UsageEvent" (plan_id, created_at DESC);
   ```

4. **Rollback Migration**:
   - Complete rollback plan tested in staging
   - Safe reversion of all optimization changes
   - Data integrity preservation

#### Expected Results
- **Query performance**: UI queries p95 ≤ 120ms for 5k row pages
- **Cost reduction**: 20-30% month-over-month database compute cost reduction
- **Maintenance**: Automated partition management

   // PF-Sig validation pattern
   const PF_SIG_PATTERN = /^pf-sig-v1:[a-f0-9]{64}:[a-f0-9]{64}:[a-f0-9]{64}$/;
   
   // Receipt schema validation
   const RECEIPT_SCHEMA = {
       required: ['id', 'tenant_id', 'action', 'timestamp', 'signature'],
       properties: { /* ... */ }
   };
   ```
